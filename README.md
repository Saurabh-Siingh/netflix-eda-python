  # üé¨ Movie Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a movie dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`) to uncover trends in movie popularity, voting patterns, and ratings. The goal is to understand the characteristics of popular and highly-rated movies using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

  # üé¨ Movie Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs exploratory data analysis on a movie dataset (`mymoviedb.csv`) to uncover trends in movie popularity, voting patterns, and ratings. The goal is to understand the characteristics of popular and highly-rated movies using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about popular movies, including:

- `Release_Date`: Date the movie was released
- `Title`: Movie title
- `Overview`: Short plot summary
- `Popularity`: Popularity score
- `Vote_Count`: Number of votes the movie received
- `Vote_Average`: Average rating
- `Original`: (Possibly original language or production flag - TBD)

### üßæ Sample Data
